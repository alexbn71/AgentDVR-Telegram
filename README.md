# AgentDVR - Telegram notifications with Image

This simple but effective script sends the image generated by AgentDVR on alerts to your Telegram bot.
It works with the free version of AgentDVR.

## CONFIGURATION

1. Copy telegram_sendphoto.sh into AgentDVR Commands folder.
2. Create "grabs" folder inside Commands folder
3. Set variable values in the script:

```bash
CHATID=your telegram id
TOKEN=your bot token
```

### 4. Go in camera Action and set these values

```bash
Actions -> Action Configuration -> If = Manual Alert (just for testing purposes)
Actions -> Action Configuration -> Then = Execute Command
Actions -> Action Configuration -> File = telegram_sendphoto
Actions -> Action Configuration -> Parameters = {ID} '{MSG}' {BASE64IMAGE}
```

You are ready to go! Fire "Manual Alert" and see what happen on Telegram.

## Telegram BOT configuration (on the web there are dozens of guides better than this):

1. Click “Start” to activate BotFather bot. In response, you receive a list of commands to manage bots.
2. Choose or type the /newbot command and send it.
3. Choose a name for your bot — your subscribers will see it in the conversation. And choose a username for your bot — the bot can be found by its username in searches. The username must be unique and end with the word “bot.”
4. After you choose a suitable name for your bot — the bot is created. You will receive a message with a link to your bot t.me/<bot_username>, recommendations to set up a profile picture, description, a list of commands to manage your new bot and the TOKEN.

Share any improvements to the script with me so that everyone can benefit!

That's all! Enjoy.
